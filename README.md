<h1><centre>Project Health Plan Pro</h1></centre>
<h2>About</h2>
This project develops a robust health insurance plan management system designed to streamline operations and enhance security across the digital landscape of healthcare services. Key features and technologies include:
<ul>
<li>Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes RabbitMQ for robust message queuing and Redis for high-speed data caching, ensuring rapid response times and scalability.</li>
<li>Advanced Security: Implements OAuth2 with RS256 for secure authentication and token validation, greatly enhancing system security and protecting sensitive health data.</li>
<li>Operational Insights: Employs Kibana for real-time visualization and monitoring of Elasticsearch data, providing deep operational insights and aiding in proactive management.</li>
<li>Sophisticated API Features: Features an API with advanced RESTful semantics, including conditional read and write operations, which optimize network and storage resources while ensuring data consistency and reliability.</li>
<li>This platform is tailored to meet the complex demands of health insurance providers, offering them a scalable solution to manage, analyze, and secure large volumes of sensitive data effectively.</li>
</ul>
